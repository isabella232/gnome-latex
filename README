GNOME LaTeX
===========

This is the version 3.36.0 of GNOME LaTeX.

GNOME LaTeX is a LaTeX editor for the GNOME desktop.

GNOME LaTeX was previously named LaTeXila. The application has been renamed in
December 2017.

GNOME LaTeX is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or
later, see the file 'COPYING' for more information.

The web site:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/GNOME-LaTeX

Dependencies
------------

* GLib >= 2.56
* GTK+ >= 3.22
* GtkSourceView >= 4.0
* Tepl >= 4.4 - https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tepl
* gspell >= 1.8
* gee-0.8 >= 0.10
* gsettings-desktop-schemas
* dconf (optional, recommended on Linux, can be disabled with
  --disable-dconf-migration)
* Latexmk >= 4.31 (optional, but strongly recommended)

And for building the sources:
* Vala >= 0.46 (may be optional)
* yelp-tools

If you are installing GNOME LaTeX from a tarball, you don't have to install
Vala because the C code is already generated.

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure from a tarball:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of gnome-latex plus its dependencies from Git,
Jhbuild is recommended. gnome-latex is in the gnome-world moduleset. An example
of a jhbuildrc file is provided:
